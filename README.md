# Introduction 
This project integrates the X-NUCLEO-IKS01A3 sensor board from STMicroelectronics with the nRF9160 Development Kit by Nordic Semiconductor.
The goal is to obtain temperature sensor values and send them to the nRF Cloud using LTE network connectivity.

# Hardware Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following hardware components:

    - nRF9160 Development Kit
    - X-NUCLEO-IKS01A3 Sensor Board
    - LTE SIM card (e.g., from Soracom.io)

# Software Requirements

Make sure you have the following software dependencies installed:

    - VS code with Nordic Connect SDK (recommended version 2.4.1)
    - nRF Cloud account with nrf9160 kit added to it [nrfcloud](https://nrfcloud.com)
